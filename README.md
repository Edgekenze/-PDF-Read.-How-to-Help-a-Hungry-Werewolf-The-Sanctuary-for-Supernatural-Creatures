Her former best friend was responsible for the worst moment of her high school life, and she can?t imagine he wants to do anything but torment her all over again.Until she unearths the real reason this annoyingly gorgeous beast of a man keeps hanging around: he?s an actual werewolf, who?s certain she?s the witch that will ease his suffering. But Cassie just isn?t sure if she can trust him again. So Seth offers a pact: he?ll teach her all about her undiscovered magic, and she will brew the potions he needs. No feelings, no funny business, just a witch and a werewolf striking a deal.Totally doable. Until they get hit with a do-or-die mating bond. </p>
